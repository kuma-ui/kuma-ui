description: Kuma UI - zero-runtime CSS-in-JS with type-safe utility props
---

Named after the Japanese word for 'bear', Kuma UI embodies the spirit of the **"ÁÜä" (kuma üêª)** - strong, reliable, and efficient. We created it to offer a zero-runtime, type-safe solution to the typical CSS-in-JS challenges, thereby ensuring your applications stay as fast and light as possible ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Performance: Ultra Fast by Design üöÄ

Kuma UI is built with performance as its cornerstone. By utilizing a **zero-runtime approach**, it extracts CSS during the build process itself, which results in an ultra fast rendering. This means your application will stay as agile and responsive as possible, delivering an optimal user experience.

**No more trade-offs** between power and performance. With Kuma UI, you can have both.

## Developer Experience: Familiar Yet Revolutionary üõ†Ô∏è

We're passionate about providing a familiar and intuitive developer experience. If you've used [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/), or [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/), you'll feel right at home with Kuma UI.

What sets Kuma UI apart? It's simple: our zero-runtime approach. This not only makes Kuma UI **performance-friendly**, but also ensures compatibility with Next.js's App Router and React Server Components (RSC).

You can write your styles just as you would with other libraries, but with Kuma UI, you enjoy superior performance and greater flexibility.
