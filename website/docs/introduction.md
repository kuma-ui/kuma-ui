Named after the Japanese word for 'bear', Kuma UI embodies the spirit of the **"熊" (kuma 🐻)** - strong, reliable, and efficient. We created it to offer a zero-runtime, type-safe solution to the typical CSS-in-JS challenges, thereby ensuring your applications stay as fast and light as possible ⚡️

## Performance: Ultra Fast by Design 🚀

Kuma UI is built with performance as its cornerstone. By utilizing a zero-runtime approach, it extracts CSS during the build process itself, which results in an ultra fast rendering. This means your application will stay as agile and responsive as possible, delivering an optimal user experience. No more trade-offs between power and performance. With Kuma UI, you can have both.
