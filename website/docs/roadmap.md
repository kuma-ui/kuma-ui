## Our Vision

At Kuma UI, our ultimate goal is to develop **a zero-runtime headless component library**. We've named our project 'Kuma UI', not 'Kuma CSS', to reflect this ambition. The current state of Kuma UI as an 'Ultra Fast, Zero Runtime, Utility-First CSS-in-JS' library is just a step towards realizing this goal.

## What Sets Us Apart

We aim to create a unique library that, similar to Chakra, allows users to pass style props like `<Box fontSize='24px' />`, but operates with zero runtime. We believe that such a utility is currently non-existent in the world.

## Our Future Path

- **Enhance the core**: Our immediate focus is on refining the `@kuma-ui/core` â€“ to improve its performance, robustness, and utility.

- **Expand component library**: Parallelly, we will work on expanding the range of headless components that Kuma UI offers. This will be done with a focus on both function and aesthetics.

- **Customizable design system**: In the future, we plan to support a `kuma.config.js` or similar file in your root directory, allowing you to define your design system's variants. Our goal is to provide a Go-to tool that adheres to your design system while being mindful of performance.

We're excited about the journey ahead and invite you to join us as we strive to create something truly unique and beneficial for the development community.
