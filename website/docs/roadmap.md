## Our Vision

At Kuma UI, our ultimate goal is to develop a zero-runtime headless component library. We've named our project 'Kuma UI', not 'Kuma CSS', to reflect this ambition. The current state of Kuma UI as an 'Ultra Fast, Zero Runtime, Utility-First CSS-in-JS' library is just a step towards realizing this goal.

## What Sets Us Apart

We aim to create a unique library that, similar to Chakra, allows users to pass style props like `<Box fontSize='24px' />`, but operates with zero runtime. We believe that such a utility is currently non-existent in the world.
