# Component Theme

In Kuma UI, you can define default and variant styles for your components globally in your theme. This feature provides a consistent look and feel across your application while allowing for extensive customization.

## Defining Component Styles

Component styles are defined in the `components` field of your theme. Each component can have a `baseStyle` and `variants`.

Here's an example of how you can define a `primary` variant for the `Button` component:

```ts
const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    Button: {
      variants: {
        primary: {
          bg: "#576ddf",
          borderRadius: "14px",
          p: "16px 32px",
          color: "white",
          fontWeight: 600,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Using Component Styles

### Base Styles

Base styles are applied to all instances of a component. They're useful for defining default appearances.

## Variants

Variants offer a way to apply different styles to components based on a prop. For example, with the above theme configuration, you can apply the `primary` variant to a `Button` like so:

<ExampleContainer>
  <PrimaryButton />
</ExampleContainer>
```tsx
<Button variant="primary">I'm a primary button</Button>
```

This approach gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of styling your components and ensuring consistency across your application.

Remember, Kuma UI is a headless library, which means styles are not applied unless you define them in your theme. Define your component styles and unleash the power of Kuma UI!
