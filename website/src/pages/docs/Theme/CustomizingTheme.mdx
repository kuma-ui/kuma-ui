# Customizing Theme

Kuma UI provides you with a flexible way to define your theme. The `createTheme` function can be used to set up theme tokens like colors and breakpoints, as well as to define base and variant styles for your components.

Note that Kuma UI is a headless component library, which means **it doesn't come with a default theme**. Styles won't be applied to your components unless you define them in your theme.

## Defining Your Theme

Here's an example of how you can define your theme:

```ts filename="kuma.config.ts"
import { createTheme } from "@kuma-ui/core";

const theme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    red: {
      100: "red",
    },
    blue: "blue",
  },
  spaces: {
    sm: "0.5rem",
    md: "1rem",
  },
  breakpoints: {
    sm: "400px",
    md: "700px",
  },
  components: {
    Button: {
      baseStyle: {
        bg: "black", // bg is short for background
        p: "10px", // p is short for padding
      },
    },
  },
});

type UserTheme = typeof theme;

declare module "@kuma-ui/core" {
  export interface Theme extends UserTheme {}
}

export default theme;
```

In the above example, the theme is defined with a set of colors, spaces, a breakpoint, as well as base styles for the Button component.

If you're using TypeScript, you can benefit from type inference when writing props for your application by extending the Kuma UI `Theme` interface with your user-defined theme:

```ts copy
type UserTheme = typeof theme;

declare module "@kuma-ui/core" {
  export interface Theme extends UserTheme {}
}
```

**Don't forget**: To leverage type inference and enable autocompletion of theme tokens and variants in your application, be sure to include `kuma.config.ts` in the include array of your `tsconfig.json`.

```ts filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "include": ["./kuma.config.ts"]
}
```

## Using the Theme

### Theme Tokens

As of now, the available theme tokens include `colors`, `fonts`, `fontSizes`, `fontWeights`, `lineHeights`, `letterSpacings`, `spaces`, `sizes`, `radii`, and `zIndices`. Check the [Theme Tokens](/docs/Theme/ThemeTokens) page for a detailed guide on using each token.

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are a separate category, defined as an object with keys being the breakpoint names and values being the CSS width values. These can be utilized in your media queries.

### Component Styles

You can define styles for your components in the `components` section of your theme. Each component can have `base` and `variants` styles:

- **Base Styles**: Base styles are applied to all instances of a component. For instance, if you set a `base` style for the Button component, all Button instances in your app will have that style.

- **Variant Styles**: Variant styles can be applied to a component by passing a `variant` prop to it. For example, if you have a `primary` variant for the Button component, you can apply it like so: `<Button variant="primary" />`.

This allows for a high degree of flexibility and consistency in styling your components across your application.
