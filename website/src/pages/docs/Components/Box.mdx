# Box

The Box is the most fundamental component from which all other Kuma UI components are constructed. It typically generates a `div` element and can incorporate any system style properties for comprehensive customization, serving as the default.

## Import

```tsx copy
import { Box } from "@kuma-ui/core";
```

## Usage

<ExampleContainer>
  <ThisIsTheBox />
</ExampleContainer>

```tsx copy
const ThisIsTheBox = () => {
  return (
    <Box p={8} bg="blue" color="white">
      Hello world
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## props

### as

The `as` prop allows you to alter the rendered element, similar to the functionality offered in Chakra UI.

<ExampleContainer>
  <ThisIsTheButton />
</ExampleContainer>

```tsx copy
const ThisIsTheButton = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      as="button"
      p={8}
      bg="black"
      color="white"
      borderRadius={4}
      _hover={{
        opacity: 0.8,
      }}
    >
      Hello world
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Props

### size

The size prop determines the size of the space. You can specify this as a string (e.g., "20px") or as a number (which will be converted to pixels).

### horizontal

The horizontal prop determines the orientation of the space. If set to true, the space will be horizontal. If left unset or set to false, the space will be vertical.
