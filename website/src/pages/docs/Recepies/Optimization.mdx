# Optimization

Kuma UI stands at the forefront of optimization in the modern web development landscape. When Kuma components are composed entirely of static styles, they are compiled to raw HTML, [achieving a performance benchmark that is on par with native HTML and CSS](https://github.com/kuma-ui/kuma-bench). This section details the underlying mechanisms that power this optimization and how you can make the most out of Kuma UI.

## Static Compilation

Consider the following component:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <HStack flexDir={["row", "column"]}>
      <Text>hello</Text>
    </HStack>
  );
}
```

Kuma UI is capable of compiling this component to a more streamlined version that resembles the following:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className={"🐻-4011430064"}>
      <p>hello</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, the Kuma component, which initially contained only static styles, is compiled to raw HTML, enhancing its performance to match that of plain HTML and CSS.

## Bundle Optimization

Furthermore, if your application doesn't incorporate dynamic styles across its entirety, **Kuma components are subjected to tree shaking, preventing them from being included in the bundle**. This technique can potentially reduce the bundle size by about 30KB, a substantial benefit for projects with stringent performance requirements.

In cases where components include dynamic styles, consider implementing asynchronous imports and leveraging code splitting to prevent these components from augmenting the bundle size.

## Dealing with Spread Syntax

When utilizing the spread syntax to pass props to Kuma components, it becomes impossible to statically analyze whether style props are contained within those props, preventing optimization.

Therefore, when employing spread syntax props, adhere to assigning classes to native HTML tags using the css function, as illustrated below:

```tsx
<div
  className={css`
    font-size: 16px;
    font-weight: 500;
  `}
/>
```

  Looking ahead, we plan to introduce a special prop that will enable developers
  to specify the compilation to raw HTML when it is predetermined that no style
  props are contained within the spread props.
