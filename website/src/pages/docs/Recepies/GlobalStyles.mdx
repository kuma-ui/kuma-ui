# Global Styles

Kuma UI scopes generated class names by default. You can use `:global` to reach selectors outside of the component.

## Example

```tsx copy
import { css } from "@kuma-ui/core";

export const globalStyles = css`
  :global(.dark-mode) & {
    color: #d0d7ff;
  }

  :global {
    ::view-transition(old) {
      opacity: 0;
    }
    ::view-transition(new) {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
`;
```

- `:global(.selector)` keeps that selector as-is in the output.
- Wrapping a block in `:global { ... }` keeps every nested selector global.
- Mix `:global` with media queries or pseudo states if needed—the compiler removes the modifier and leaves your selectors untouched.
